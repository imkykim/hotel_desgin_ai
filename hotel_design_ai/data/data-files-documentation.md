## 7. Common Modifications

Here are examples of common modifications you might want to make:

### Adding a New Room Type

1. Create a room type definition in `data/room_types/`:

```json
{
  "name": "Executive Office",
  "type": "executive_office",
  "dimensions": {
    "width": 5.0,
    "length": 7.0,
    "height": 3.5
  },
  "requirements": {
    "natural_light": true,
    "exterior_access": true,
    "min_area": 35.0,
    "preferred_adjacencies": ["office"],
    "avoid_adjacencies": ["kitchen", "service_area"]
  }
}
```

2. Use it in program requirements:

```json
"executive_suite": {
  "area": 35,
  "room_type": "executive_office",
  "min_width": 5.0,
  "min_height": 3.5,
  "requires_natural_light": true,
  "requires_adjacency": ["office"]
}
```

3. Add constraints for it:

```json
{
  "type": "adjacency",
  "room_type1": "executive_office",
  "room_type2": "office",
  "weight": 1.5,
  "description": "Executive offices should be near regular offices"
}
```

### Changing Building Configuration

To create a compact version of the hotel:

```json
{
  "width": 40.0,
  "length": 50.0,
  "height": 30.0,
  "num_floors": 6,
  "floor_height": 5.0,
  "structural_grid_x": 8.0,
  "structural_grid_y": 8.0,
  "grid_size": 1.0,
  "main_entry": "south"
}
```

Run with this configuration:

```bash
python main.py --building-config compact
```

### Prioritizing Constraints

To emphasize natural light more than other factors:

1. Edit weight in exterior constraints:

```json
{
  "type": "exterior",
  "room_type": "guest_room",
  "weight": 2.5,  // Increased from 1.5
  "description": "Guest rooms should have exterior access"
}
```

2. Adjust RL weights:

```json
"weights": {
  "space_efficiency": 1.0,
  "adjacency_satisfaction": 1.0,
  "circulation_quality": 1.0,
  "natural_light": 2.0,  // Increased from 0.8
  "structural_alignment": 0.8
}
```

### Creating a Custom Program

Create a smaller hotel program:

1. Create `data/program/small_hotel.json`:

```json
{
  "public": {
    "lobby": {
      "area": 300,
      "room_type": "lobby",
      "min_width": 15.0,
      "min_height": 4.5,
      "requires_natural_light": true
    },
    "restaurant": {
      "area": 200,
      "room_type": "restaurant",
      "min_width": 12.0,
      "min_height": 4.0,
      "requires_natural_light": true
    }
  },
  // Add other departments...
}
```

2. Run with this program:

```bash
python main.py --program-config small_hotel
```
